With Linux being largely server-oriented, the system keeps logs of different programs in /var/log/ folder

/var/log/secure file contains information on users logging in and out and password operations

Most of system logs can be found in /var/log/messages file

tail -F $FILE - follow file additions in real time

which $COMMAND - find out command's exact path

JournalDaemon is a program that keeps track of syslogs. 'journalctl' command lets you find and analyze
syslogs in a smarter way.

journalctl - see all system logs
journalctl -e - see all system logs from end
journalctl -f - see system logs with follow mode in real time
journalctl $COMMAND_PATH - show logs generated by command specified
journalctl -u $UNIT - show logs generated by unit specified
journalctl -p $PRIORITY - show only logs tagged with priority specified

Priorities (from least to most critical):
- info
- warning
- err
- crit
