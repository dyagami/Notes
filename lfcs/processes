ps - view running processes at the exact time of entering the command - this command without arguments
shows only the processes launched in a current terminal window
ps aux - view all processes launch on the system in a BSD-style format

in 'ps aux' output:

%CPU - $CORES.$USAGE_OF_NTH_CORE
TIME - time in seconds where 100% of one CPU core was used by the process, it calculates as total time, ex.
50% of one CPU core for 10 seconds means 5 seconds added to 'TIME'
COMMAND - exact command used for starting the processs. Commands put in square brackets are kernel processes
started in a privileged kernel area.

top - view system processes in real-time view

ps (u) $PID - view info on process with PID specified
ps -U $USER - show all processes started by user specified
pgrep -a $NAME - view info of process with name specified

Niceness value is a way of prioritizing processes above other processes. The lower the niceness value, the
more important the process is and is more likely to acquire CPU usage. Niceness ranges from -20 to 19. Only
root can set something to negative number, so assigning a Niceness value below 0 will need to be run with
'sudo'.

nice -n $NICE_VALUE $PROCESS - start a process with Niceness specified.
renice $NICE_VALUE $PID - change Niceness of an existing process
ps -l - show processes of current user with Niceness values
ps lax - show all system processes with Niceness values
ps fax - show forest view of all system processes
ps faux - show forest view of all system processes with Niceness column

Processes inherit Niceness values from the processes that ran them.

You can send specific signals to processes. If they were programmed to do so, they should respond to these
signals. Some signals are special and will work on any process as in 'sigkill' signal, which kills a process
without letting it save any data.

kill -L - show signal list
kill -$SIGNAME $PID OR kill -$SIGNUMBER $PID - send a signal to the PID specified

CTRL-C - exit a process
CTRL-Z - suspend a process to the background
fg - go back to suspended process
$COMMAND & - run command in a background
jobs - see paused or backgrounded programs
fg $NUMBER - foreground a program specified
bg $NUMBER - change state of a backgrounded process
lsof -p $PID - show all open files and directories for the process specified
lsof $/DIRECTORY/FILE - show which process uses file or directory specified. Recommended to always run as root.
