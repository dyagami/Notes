cat - content as text - view file contents in terminal
tac - view file contents in terminal in reverse line order
head (-n $LINES) - view file content beginning
tail (-n $LINES) - view file content ending
man $COMMAND - see manual page for a command
man $SECTION $COMMAND (ex. 'man 7 man' for manual page section 7 for command man) - show man page from section
specified for command specified
man -k $REGEXP (or 'apropos $REGEXP') - look up command associated in man pages with string specified

	Note:
	Man sections worth your while as a sysadmin will be 1 (executable programs and shell commands) and 8
	(system administration commands)

	Note:
	If you encounter a new command, pause and read through man pages first, so you can get accustomed to
	getting what info you need from them quickly

'cd -' - get back to previous directory
stat $FILE - show detailed info about a file
ln $TARGET_PATH $LINK_PATH - create a hard link to a file (instead of copying data)

	Note:
	Hard links work only for files, not directories. Also, the target and link paths must be on the same
	filesystem. The file gets deleted only when it has 0 hard links. It means that deleting the original
	hard link doesn't cut the file if another hard link was created. All of these point to the Inode
	value, which is an ID method of linking to different disk sectors containing the file's data.
	!!IMPORTANT!!
	Linux filesystem permissions are stored in Inodes. This means that two hard links to one Inode will
	have shared permissions and ownership.

ln -s $TARGET_PATH $LINK PATH - create a symbolic link to a file

	Note:
	If a file is actually a symbolic link to another file, the 'ls -l' command will show us 'l' at the
	front of a permission string and also a path that a symbolic link links to.

readlink $SYMLINK_PATH - shows a path which the symbolic link points to

	Note:
	(symlink == symbolic link == softlink)
	If original file changes its path, the symbolic link will break. The broken symlinks are highlighted
	in red in 'ls -l' command output. You CAN softlink to directories.
