The most widely used database server software is called MariaDB. It's an open-source  fork of MySQL, so it will
work in a very similar way.

- Install, start and allow MariaDB through firewall. Since MariaDB is a fork of MySQL, it will use the same ports
and "MySQL" keyword will still appear throughout many commands.

sudo dnf install mariadb-server
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb.service
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=mysql
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=mysql --permanent


You will need to configure MariaDB, since default configuration lets anynone on the system log in as superuser
using "mysql -u root" command. You can do so very simply, by issuing "mysql_secure_installation" command. A wizard
will walk you through the hardening process. MariaDB configuration file is located at /etc/my.cnf. This file is
almost blank and points to /etc/my.cnf.d directory. There you will find mariadb-server.cnf file, which will 
contain most of MariaDB's configuration. It can be treated as the main MariaDB configuration file. 

"

[mysqld]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql 		# This variable sets directory of the databases
socket=/var/lib/myssql/mysql.sock 	# This variable sets socket file location. Most of applications that will
					use MariaDB will look for socket to enter through in the default location.
log-error=/var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log	# That's the file where errors are going to be logged
pid-file=/run/mariadb/mariadb.pid	# This files stores PID of a process under which database daemon runs


[galera]
bind-address=0.0.0.0 	# This is the address that MariaDB listens on. By default, it listens on every IP on the
			internet.

"

If you're ever forced to use legacy MySQL server, the main configuration file will be located in the same directory
under "mysql-server.cnf" filename.
