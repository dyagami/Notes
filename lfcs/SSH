OpenSSH daemon is included in most Linux distributions and may be running by default. It's config is located at
/etc/ssh/sshd_config. A similar naming convention applies to SSH Client, which configuration file is located at
/etc/ssh/ssh_config. SSH Client is preinstalled on every Windows system from Windows 10 up and every Mac OS and
Linux machine. Remember that you can find manual pages for config files too. Settings in sshd_config are global
meaning anyone who tries to log in through SSH on the server will have these settings apply to them.

sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

"

Port 22		# The default port is 22, it can be changed for security purposes (there are bots that are scraping
		different IPs for default SSH port and trying password attacks on them)
AddressFamily any 	# This specifies if SSHD should use IPv4 ("inet" option) IPv6 ("inet6" option) or both
			("any" option)
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0	# This specifies what IP SSHD should listen on (this is useful in situations where you have
			two or more NICs connected to server and maybe you want to only allow connections from
			certain networks, like only internal network, instead of internet too). SSHD listens for
			incoming connections on all addresses by default.
ListenAddress ::	# The same option for IPv6
PermitRootLogin yes	# This allows root to log in from the SSH connection. Wise to keep it disabled for security
			concerns.
PaswordAuthentication yes	# This allows password logins, which do not require SSH keys to be present in
				known_hosts file. It's generally better to allow SSH logins only with SSH keys,
				which are more secure.
X11Forwarding yes 	# This lets you forward X11 GUI-based application window through SSH to the Client

Match User $USER
	PasswordAuthentication yes 	# This syntax lets you set some option only for user specified

"

SSH Client keeps user configuration in ~/.ssh/config file. You can check options that are available to use in
such file using "man ssh_config". The file needs to have read and write permissions for user and no permissions for
everybody else for security purposes.

"

Host $name		# This specifies a predefined host for you to use "ssh $name" command alias instead of
	HostName $IP	writing user and IP manually each time
	Port 22
	User $USERNAME

"

"ssh-keygen" command lets you create pair of SSH keys for current user. It creates id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files in
~/.ssh directory. id_rsa.pub file contents is your public key that you can add to /etc/ssh/known_hosts file on your
server to let you authenticate on this server with your private key as any user or you can add it to
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file for the user you want to be able to log in as. You can transfer your public key to the
user's authorized_keys file easily by using "ssh-copy-id $USER@$IP" command.

ssh-keygen -R $IP - remove IP specified from local known_hosts file

If you want to edit system-wide SSH Client configuration, you should create a new config file in
/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/ folder, because an SSH client update can overwrite the default config at /etc/ssh/ssh_config.
The naming convention is $PRIORITY-$NAME.conf.
