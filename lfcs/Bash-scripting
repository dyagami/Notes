Every Bash script should begin with a shebang. Shebang is a '#!' expression followed by a path for script
interpreter (in our case Bash shell)
#!/bin/bash
# is a comment
You can use every Linux command in a Bash script.
It is wise to save command outputs in one file for each script, ex. /tmp/script.log
Script file needs execute permission to be executed.
./#FILE.sh to run script.
if conditional statement works as in other languages, but needs to be closed using 'fi'
example:

if test -f /tmp/archive.tar.gz; then
	mv /tmp/archive.tar.gz
/tmp/archive.tar.gz.OLD
	tar acf /tmp/archive.tar.gz /etc/dnf/
else
	tar acf /tmp/archive.tar.gz /etc/dnf
fi

The code above checks if an archive file exists and renames it to the same name with '.OLD' suffix and
then creates the new archive. If there's no file with such name present, it just creates the archive.
'test' function checks if file exists and returns True or False boolean values for corresponding cases.
