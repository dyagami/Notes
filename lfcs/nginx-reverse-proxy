- Install Nginx
sudo apt install nginx
- Add a .conf file for proxy config
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy.conf

"

server {
 listen 80;
 location /{		#location that requests for will be proxied
  proxy_pass http://1.1.1.1; #Destination webserver the proxy should redirect to
  include proxy_params;  #/etc/nginx/proxy_params
 }

"

- Softlink created file to sites-enabled directory (since Nginx only uses files in /etc/sites-enabled
directory)
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled proxy
- Delete default config (it's a softlink too, so it won't be deleted completely from your system)
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
- Test for errors
sudo nginx -t
- Reload Nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx.service
