SELinux is a Kernel security module that 

To see SELinux Context Label on files and directories, use 'ls -Z' command
SELinux Context Label format looks like this:

unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0
   user	       role	type	  level

Each user that logs into the system gets mapped to a predefined SELinux user as a part of the Linux policy
configuration. After the user is identified, a decision is made to see if it can assume the Role.
Each user can only assume a predefined set of Roles. Each Role gives user different permissions. 
Next a check is performed to see if this Role can transition to a Type. Type is like a protective software
jail where when something enters type enforcement, it can only do certain things and nothing else.
This restriction bubble is called Type when dealing with files and Domain when dealing with processes.
Processes can have labels too, just like files and directories.

SELinux basically follows these principles:

1. Only certain users can enter certain Roles and certain Types
2. It lets authorized users and processes do theri job, by granting the permissions they need
3. Authorized users and processes are allowed to  take onlym a limited set of actions.
4. Everything else is denied

ps axZ - view processes with SELinux Context Labels
id -Z - view Context Label for current user
sudo semanage login -l - view Context Label for all users
getenforce - check if SELinux is enforcing its policies. 'Enforcing' means SELinux is applying policies.
'Permissive' means it's allowing everything and just logging events that would trigger policy enforcement.
'Disabled' means SELinux is not enforcing security nor logging anything.

Linux Distros that don't have SELinux may have apparmor application installed instead (ex. Ubuntu).

If you want to install SELinux on a system that doesn't have it yet, it's best practice to install it on
fresh OS before installing any other application. To do so, you should first disable apparmor:
sudo systemctl stop apparmor.service
sudo systemctl disable apparmor.service
sudo apt install selinux-basics auditd

Audit Daemon service is a utility that logs certain system events and helps build additional Linux
SELinux security policies personalized for your system

sestatus - check if SELinux is running

For SELinux to work, it has to have its module activated in kernel by boot loader. Also, every file on the
filesystem needs to be labeled by SELinux Context.

sudo selinux-activate - Configure bootloader to load SELinux Kernel Module at boot. This command also
creates '.autorelabel' file in root directory that will label every filesystem file with SELinux Context
Labels.


//Install SELinux on fresh Ubuntu Server install for training
