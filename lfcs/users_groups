sudo useradd -s $SHELL -d $HOME_DIR -u $ID $USER - add a user
sudo passwd $USER - set password for user
sudo userdel (-r to remove home dir) $USER - delete a user 

/etc/passwd file contains all user and group info for each user
id - see current user info, to see just username, use 'whoami'

sudo useradd --system - create a system account. System accounts are used not for users, but rather
for programs, especially daemons. This user won't have a home directory.

sudo usermod -d $NEW_HOME_DIR -m $USER - move user's home directory to another path. '-m' argument moves
files that were in the old home directory to a new directory. Without this argument only the location
will change.

sudo usermod -l $OLD_NAME $NEW_NAME - rename a user
sudo usermod -L (or --lock) - disable (lock) user's account without deleting it
sudo usermod -U (or --unlock) - unlock user's account
sudo usermod -e (or --expiredate) $DATE $USER - make user expire on set date. Set blank date ("") to disable
user expiration
sudo chage -d (or --lastday) $DATE/DAYS $USER - change time on when a user has to change their password.
Set to 0 to make them change their password on next login. Set to -1 to unrequire a password change.
sudo chage -M (or --maxdays) $DAYS - make user change their password every number of days
sudo chage -l (or --list) $USER - see user's change age settings
groupadd/groupdel $GROUP - add or delete a group

Each user can belong to one or more groups, but he has only one Primary Group (a so-called Login Group).
When a process is started, it runs with group priviliges of a user and group that started it. It is the
same when creating a file.

sudo gpasswd --add $USER $GROUP - add user to a group
groups $USER - see groups which user belongs to

The first group that shows up is the Primary Group which the user belongs to
sudo usermod -g $USER - change user's Primary Group
sudo usermod -G $USER - change user's Secondary Group
sudo groupmod $OLD_NAME -n (or --new-name) $NEW_NAME - rename a group
sudo groupdel $GROUP - delete a group. You cannot remove user's Primary Group. If you want to delete such
group, you first need to remove user from this group.
