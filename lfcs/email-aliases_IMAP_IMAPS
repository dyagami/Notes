Emails in Linux are saved by default in /var/spool/mail/$USERNAME directory. You can set up email aliases for
a user so mails sent to different addresses will all come to this one same user. To set up a a proof of concept,
you will use software named postfix.

sudo dnf install postfix -y && sudo systemctl enable --now postfix

- Send example email to a user and see its contents

sendmail $USER@localhost <<< "Hello, I'm just testing email"
cat /var/spool/mail/$USER

- Email aliases are defined in /etc/aliases file. You can add new alias for your user in this file

sudo vim /etc/aliases

"
advertising:	$USER
contact:	$USER1,$USER2,$USER3
support:	support@somewebsite.com
"

- Inform postfix about new added alias

sudo newaliases

- Send emails to both aliases to test them. Email sent to advertising@localhost should arrive at
/var/spool/mail/$USER.
Emails sent to contact@localhost should arrive to three boxes at:
/var/spool/mail/$USER1
/var/spool/mail/$USER2
/var/spool/mail/$USER3
Emails sent to support@localhost will go to external server at support@somewebsite.com

sendmail advertising@localhost <<< "Testing advertising alias"
cat /var/spool/mail/$USER1
sendmail contact@localhost <<< "Testing contact alias"
cat /var/spool/mail/$USER1
cat /var/spool/mail/$USER2
cat /var/spool/mail/$USER3


If you want to be able to receive your mail in external apps like MS Outlook, Thunderbird, or maybe some mobile
app, you need to configure an IMAP Server. IMAP is short for Internet Message Access Protocol. A common IMAP daemon
in Linux is Dovecot. An email client logs into Dovecot, which then retrieves your user's mail and sends it to the
client. In the default configuration cClient and server are synchronized in a way that the client can control what
mail is stored, deleted, sent, etc., but it can be changed. IMAP doesn't encrypt communication by default. IMAPS
(IMAP over SSL) solves this. This is a legacy name, since SSL was faulty and was replaced by TLS. You can also call
it IMAP Secure, so it doesn't get confusing. To use TLS with Dovecot, first allow IMAP connections in firewall (port
143 for standard and 993 for TLS).

sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=imap
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=imap --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=imaps
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=imaps --permanent

- Now edit the configuration file at /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf

sudo vim /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf

"
protocols = imap	# this is going to enable both IMAP and IMAPS
listen = 10.11.12.9, ::	# use "*" for listen on all IPv4 addresses and :: for listen on all IPv6 addresses
"

Dovecot has its configuration divided into different files, as one file with all configuration would be too big to
comprehend efficiently. These are locatd at /etc/dovecot/conf.d directory. You can find authentication-related 
settings in 10-auth.conf file and 10-mail.conf file will determine where Dovecot should take mail from.
In 10-ssl.conf file you can configure how the data sent received through the IMAPS should be encrypted. The numbers
in naming convention of these files say what the priority of each file is. To change default ports Dovecot listens
for incoming connections on, you can edit 10-master.conf file. To edit where mail is stored on your server, you can
edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf file. 

sudo vim /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf

"
	mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u  # "mbox:~/mail" part tells Dovecot to create mailbox for
							each user in their home folder and keep their mail there

"

/var/mail directory is a symlink do /var/spool/mail directory, so they both point to the same place

- To set up TLS on your server, edit /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf

"

ssl = required		# This means that Dovecot will accept only Secured connections. To accept both encrypted and
			unencrypted connections, change the value to "yes" instead of "required". As the proof of
			concept doesn't cover generating SSL certificates, you will use the unencrypted connection.
ssl_cert = </etc/pki/dovecot/certs/dovecot.pem 		# This is where you tell Dovecot where to find the
ssl_key = </etc/pki/dovecot/private/dovecot.pem		certificate and private key

"

- Test your server with a GUI email application to see if it downloads your mail
