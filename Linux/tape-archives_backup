tar = tape archive. Tape archives have .tar extensions and are called tarballs.
tar $ARGS $FILENAME.tar $FILE1 $FILE2...  - make a tar archive. '-t' lists files. '-c' tells tar
to create new archive. '-r' to append files to an existing archive. '-A' appends archive to the end
of another archive. '-f' specifies output file and should be added as the last argument. '-x' to
extract files from archive. '-C' to specify output directory for extraction. '-z' to compress tarball
on the fly with gzip. 'j' to do the same with bzip2. 'J' to do the same with xz. '-a' makes for an
autocompression.d

To compress tar archives or regular files, you can use one of three compression standards:
gzip $FILE - gunzip $FILE.gz to decompress 
bzip2 $FILE - bunzip $FILE.bz to decompress
xz $FILE - unxz $FILE.xz to decompress
While decompressing, you can use (-k) argument to keep original file.

zip $NAME $FILE - create a zip archive. You can only pass a single file or folder to a one zip archive
using zip command. '-r' to use recursively with folders. 'unzip $FILE' to decompress an archive.

rsync -a $DIR $USER@$IP/$REMOTE_DIR - remote synchronization. This command lets you synchronize local
files with remote server. The remote server has to have SSH daemon installed and enabled. You can 
invert paths in syntax to synchronize remote directory with local directory. You can also synchronize
two local directories.

sudo dd if=$DIR of=$OUTPUTFILE bs=1M status=progress - create one-to-one disk image. bs refers to block
size. You can invert Input File and Output File to unpack image. DO NOT RUN ON VM, as it will overwrite
your virtual disk.
