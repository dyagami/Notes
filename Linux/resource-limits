To edit each user's resource limits on the system, you can edit /etc/security/limits.conf.
Using asterisk as domain sets the limit for every user on the system. When you add limit
for specific user, it overrides the asterisk limit. Asterisk limit only applies to users
that are not mentioned in the file.

Regarding the type field, a hard limit is a limit that cannot be raised by regular user
no matter what. The soft limit is an initial limit that can be overriden by user. If you
specify both, a user can raise his limit from soft to a maximum of a value that hard limit
is set to. Dash means both soft and hard limit. The user cannot cross the dash limit. 

example items are::
nproc - maximum processes that can be run by user session
fsize - maximum file size that can be created in this user session
cpu - CPU time in minutes. If a process uses 100% of one CPU core for one second, it will
use one second of it's allocated time.

To see all items, look up man page of limits.conf file

sudo -iu $USERNAME - make a real log in as another user
ulimit -a - view limits for current session

You can raise ulimit values using arguments specified in the output of "ulimit -a" command
if the current user has soft and hard limits specified, but you can raise a limit only once,
then you can only lower it.
