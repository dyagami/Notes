SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are ways of authentication for various
connections. SSL is a legacy, more vulnerable way of authenticating communications between hosts. TLS have
replaced SSL, but SSL was used for a very long time. Because of that, sometimes TLS is being called
SSL, since the name stuck with community. TLS and SSL prove hosts' crediblity to each other using
encrypted certificates. OpenSSL is a Linux pre-installed software for making both SSL and TLS certificates.
It can also be used for many other cryptographic operations, including private and public keys, encryption
and decryption with ciphers, handling encrypted mail, etc. The feature we're interested with for TLS is
creation of X.509 certificates.

openssl req - create Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and private key pair for authentication of remote
host
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 	-keyout privatekey.pem 		-out req.pem
			^cipher complexity   ^private key output file	^ CSR request as file
openssl req -x509 -noenc -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out mycertificate.crt
-x509 - flag that creates a certificate which can be used for signing CSR from other host

openssl x509 - certificate display and signing command
openssl x509 -in $FILE -text - display decoded certificate above encoded version
