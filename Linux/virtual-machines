Popular virtualization software for Linux is QEMU (Quick Emulator) KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), which are
actually two pieces of software that interconnect. QEMU simulates a virtual computer and KVM is a code included
in the Linux kernel that uses hardware technology meant to speed up virtual machines. There's a CLI-based
front-end for managing virtual machines called Virsh. 

- Install Qemu and Virsh

sudo dnf install -y libvirt qemu-kv

Libvirt includes utilities that let you interact with virtual machines and QEMU lets you create and run them.
After installing QUEMU and Virsh, you should create an .xml configuration file for your virtual machine. 

"

<domain type="qemu">
	<name>TestMachine</name>	# Name of your machine
	<memory unit="GB">1</memory>	# Amount of allocated RAM
	<vcpu>1</vcpu>		# Amount of allocated virtual CPU cores
	<os>
		<type arch='x86_64'>hvm</type>	# Os type and architecture, "hvm" stands for "Hardware Virtual
						Machine". A real virtual machine needs storage, network card and
						an operating system installed, "hvm" will be a keyword here to
						start a barebones bootable machine.
	</os>
</domain>

"

- Define machine from your configuration file with Virsh

virsh define $FILENAME.xml

In Virsh's context, "domain" basically refers to a virtual machine.

- Start your newly defined virtual machine

virsh start $NAME

virsh shutdown $NAME - Set shutdown signal to your virtual machine
virsh reboot $NAME - Reboot your virtual machine. This basically sends reboot signal to the operating system
running on your virtual machine, so the reboot should be a graceful process that lets applications save their
data.
virsh reset $NAME - Do a hard reboot for your machine
virsh destroy $NAME - Do a hard poweroff for your machine
virsh undefine $NAME - Delete your machine. Machine has to be powered off for this to work.  This only deletes the
machine, but leaves its data (virtual hard disks, etc.)
virsh udefine --remove-all-storage - Completely remove machine with all of its data.
virsh autostart (--disable) $NAME - Enable or disable autostart with host OS boot for your machine
virsh dominfo $NAME - View info about your virtual machine
virsh set vcpus $NAME $COUNT (--config/--live/--current/--guest/--hotpluggable/--maximum) - set virtual CPU count
for your virtual machine
	--config - affect next boot
	--live - affect running domain
	--current - affect current domain
	--guest - modify cpu state in the guest
	--hotpluggable - make added vcpus hot(un)pluggable
	--maximum - set maximum limit on next boot
virsh setmaxmem $NAME $SIZE (--config...) - Set maximum RAM for your virtual machine


Ubuntu uses different software for virtual machines, which is called virt-manager.

Install virt-manager and download an operating system image (in this case you'll use Ubuntu cloud-optimized .img minimal distribution
image)

sudo apt install virt-manager -y
wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/minimal/releases/jammy/release/ubuntu-22.04-minimal-cloudimg-amd64.img

You can get info on the image using "qemu-img info $FILENAME". This particular image's virtual size is 2.2 GiB.
This means that the virtual disk on this image is configured to have size of 2.2 GiB. To expand the size of the
virtual disk, you can run "qemu-img resize $FILENAME $SIZE".
