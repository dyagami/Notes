Popular virtualization software for Linux is QEMU (Quick Emulator) KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), which are
actually two pieces of software that interconnect. QEMU simulates a virtual computer and KVM is a code included
in the Linux kernel that uses hardware technology meant to speed up virtual machines. There's a CLI-based
front-end for managing virtual machines called Virsh. 

- Install Qemu and Virsh

sudo dnf install -y libvirt qemu-kvm
