You can set up a proxy server in the internal network to route traffic through it instead of letting clients access
web servers directly if you want to, for example, restrict website access, cache frequently accessed websites for
efficiency, or maybe analyze the traffic for malicious files, links, protocols, etc. The proxy will essentially
sit at the middle of communications from your network to other networks. A commonly used proxy daemon is called
Squid.

sudo dnf install -y squid && sudo systemctl enable --now squid.service

By default, firewall will block connections to and from the service, so you should add a policy to allow it

sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=squid
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=squid --permanent

Squid configuration file is located at /etc/squid/squid.conf

"

acl localnet src 0.0.0.1-0.555.255.255  # acl stands for "Access Control List" and is an entry that enables routing
					any network traffic from the specified IP or IP range through your proxy.
					"src" type specifies a source IP.
acl youtube dstdomain .youtube.com	# "dstdomain" type specifies destination domain as an acl
acl SSL_ports port 443	# "port" type specifies a destination port on which proxy can be accessed
http_access deny !Safe_ports 	# This line denies access through ports that are not specified by "Safe_ports" acl
http_access deny to_localhost	# This line denies proxy users to access other services hosted on localhost. It's
				a best practice to keep it uncommented.
http_access allow localnet	# This line allows IPs specified in localnet acl to connect through your proxy
http_access deny youtube	# This line denies proxy user access to youtube domain and any subdomains

"

After making changes to the squid.conf file, you should reload the service. Reloading the service lets people who
may be doing something that will get denied with new configuration finish their work, ex. complete the downloading
of a file o finish their YouTube browsing session. To enforce new rules for all sessions abruptly, you should
instead restart the service.
