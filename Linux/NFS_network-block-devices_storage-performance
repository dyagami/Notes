There are multiple protocols allowing access to remote filesystems. Protocol is, in a way, a language that client
and server use to speak to each other. To share filesystems between two Linux systems, most often NFS is used. To
use NFS Server, you should first install nfs-kernel server package (Ubuntu) or nfs-utils (CentOS). Then you should
specify what directories you want to be shared on the network by editing /etc/exports file.

sudo apt install -y nfs-kernel-server&& sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-kernel-server.service
OR
sudo dnf install -y nfs-utils && sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-server.service

/etc/exports file contains list of directories that will be shared to the network.

"

/srv/homes	$HOSTNAME1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) $IP1/$SUBNET(ro,sync) $IP2(all_squash,rw)
/etc 127.0.01(ro) # This entry indicates that /etc folder is shared for localhost IP and is read-only. Such
		  entries let you share directories TO specific IP addresses, ranges, or networks (in CIDR
		  notation)
/share *.example.com(ro,sync)

"

Export options that are specified in /etc/exports are:
ro - Read Only
rw - Read/Write
sync - Synchronous writes - NFS ensures that data written by the client is successfully saved on the server berfore
reporting operation success
async - Asynchronous writes - Client can issue multiple write requests and NFS can report hat the writes are
completed even before the're actually saved on the storage device
no_subtree_check - disables subtree checking - Disables strict subdirectory checking, which can cause issues when
files are renamed or moved, this is a default behavior
no_root_squash - allows root user in NFS client to also have root priviliges on a remote NFS share
root_squash - assigns every user who tries to log in to NFS Share as root to a regular user called Nobody
all_squash - map all uids and gids to anonymous user. Useful for public FTP directories.

To apply settings done in /etc/exports file, use "sudo exportfs -r" (re-export) command. This does a refresh based
on the /etc/exports file. To see current exports with their options, use "sudo exportfs -v" command.

NFS client is included in nfs-common package. To mount a remote NFS directory, use:

sudo mount $IP/HOSTNAME:/$REMOTE_PATH /$LOCAL_PATH

You can then add the nfs mountpoint to your /etc/fstab file.
