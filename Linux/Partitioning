To enable your storage device to use different filesystems, you have to partition it accordingly, ex.
one NTFS partition for a Windows system and one ext4 partition for dual-booting it with a Linux system. 

lsblk - list block devices

Block devices are basically blocks of storage space that Linux can store in and retrieve data from.
Only block devices of type "part" are logical partitions. In the output, the device sda is a virtual
disk and sda1, sda2 and so on are partitions on that disk. The disk devices on virtual machines typically
begin with letter "V". "S" stands for "serial" and means serial devices that may be connected to SATA or
ATA port on the motherboard. If you use NVMe devices, they will be named as "nvme".
