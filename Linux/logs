With Linux being largely server-oriented, the system keeps logs of different programs in /var/log/ folder

/var/log/secure file contains information on users logging in and out and password operations

Most of system logs can be found in /var/log/messages file

tail -F $FILE - follow file additions in real time

which $COMMAND - find out command's exact path

JournalDaemon is a program that keeps track of syslogs. 'journalctl' command lets you find and analyze
syslogs in a smarter way.

journalctl - see all system logs
journalctl -e - see all system logs from end
journalctl -f - see system logs with follow mode in real time
journalctl $COMMAND_PATH - show logs generated by command specified
journalctl -u $UNIT - show logs generated by unit specified
journalctl -p $PRIORITY - show only logs tagged with priority specified
journalctl -g '$REGEX' - grep log entries
journalctl -S $TIME - show log entries since given time
journalctl -U $TIME - show log entries until given time
journalctl -b $NUMBER - show logs from boot specified (0 is current)

JournalD doesn't save logs on the disk by default. You can change this by creating /var/log/journal directory.

last - see the history of who logged into the system
lastlog - see when each user on the system logged in last time

Remember that you can always combine arguments.

Priorities (from least to most critical):

debug - Debug-level messages
info - Informational messages
notice - Normal but significant condition
warning or warn - Warning conditions
err or error - Error conditions
crit - Critical conditions
alert - Immediate action required
emerg - System is unusable
