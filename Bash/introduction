A Bash script has to have three different core components for it to be written correctly. First,
you have to add a so-called Shebang, which is a directory for the interpreter that should be used
to read your script. Shebang line looks like this:

#!/bin/bash

This directory will be different if you use different interpreter than Bash (Zsh, Csh, Sh, etc.)

After the Shebang, you should put your script's code with Bash commands and preferably comments
about what each function, logic or line does (This is the best practice to make your code easy to
interpret by someone else, or yourself if your code starts getting  long and complicated). You may
want to add usage instructions, Time Created, Time Last Modified, Author or Description in comments.
Usage instructions and inline comments are bare minimum to let someone know how to use your script.

At the end of the script (and in some cases in your code), you should put an exit statement.
"exit 0" means that the script exited successfully with no errors and should be placed as the last
line of each script to indicate that it was executed correctly. Any other number than 0 indicates
that there were errors in running the script.

Script has to have .sh extension for it to work. To run a script, user has to have execute
permissions on the script file. To add such permission, you should use the following command:

sudo chmod u+x $FILE.sh
