At command is used to shedule tasks. You can use it to schedule execution of your scripts.
For at command to work, At Daemon (atd) must be running on the system. You can use at
interactively by issuing the "at $TIME" command.. Then you can write any commands and press 
CTRL-D to finish. To list scheduled jobs use "atq". To remove a job, use "atrm $JOB". "at 
$TIME -f $FILE" lets you specify a script file that should be run at scheduled time. You
can also pipe specific command to at to schedule it. At doesn't allow recurring jobs.
To schedule recurring jobs, you should use cron. Cron, like at, works by running a daemon
service (cron) in the background. You can schedule cron jobs using crontab. System-wide
crontab is located at /etc/crontab. To edit crontab for current user, use "crontab -e" command
and to edit crontab for another user (ex. root user), you should use "crontab -e $USER".
System-wide crontab lets you specify user as which cron will run the job. After editing
system-wide crontab, you have to restart cron service for your entries to take effect.
