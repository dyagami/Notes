Quoting in Bash is about Removing Special Meanings from the characters so they are interpreted
literally by the Shell. 

Backslash (\) removes special meaning from next character. The literal backslash, if not escaped,
is then removed in the Quote Removal step by Shell.

Single Quotes ('') remove special meaning from all characters inside. Single quotes cannot contain
another single quotes, even if escaped by the backslash.

Double Quotes ("") remove special meaning from all except dollar signs ($) and backticks (`).
Everything put into backticks is evaluted in a new subshell, so you get the output when you
reference the command that you put there. Double quotes, while allow you to use Command
Substitution, also let you escape dollar sign and backtick characters using backslash.

Ampersand (&) has a special meaning to the shell - it tells Bash to run the command in front
of it in the background.

Filepaths should be run either so the each slash is escaped by a backslash and so interpreted 
literally, or in single quotes.
