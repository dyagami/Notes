Quoting in Bash is about Removing Special Meanings from the characters so they are interpreted
literally by the Shell. 

Backslash (\) removes special meaning from next character. The literal backslash, if not escaped,
is then removed in the Quote Removal step by Shell.

Single Quotes ('') removes special meaning from all characters inside. Single quotes cannot contain
another singel quotes, even if escaped by the backslash.

Double Quotes ("") removes special meaning from all except dollar signs ($) and backticks (`).
Everything put into backticks is evaluted in a new subshell, so you get the output when you
reference the command that you put there. Double quotes, while allow you to use Command
Substitution, also let you escape dollar sign and backtick characters using backslash.

Ampersand (&) has a special meaning to the shell - it tells Bash to run the command in front
of it in the background.

Filepaths should be run either with double backslashes, so the each second backslash is escaped
by the first one and so interpreted literally, or in single quotes.
