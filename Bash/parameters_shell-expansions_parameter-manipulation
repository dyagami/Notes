Parameter is any entity that stores values. Shell parameters are used to store and reference
useful data that you can use in your scripts. Shell parameters are categorized into Variables,
Positional Parameters and Special Parameters. 

User-defined Variables are declared as follows, using all lowercase:

"

name="string"
name=1
name=1.1
name= "$COMMAND"

"

You can also declare variables directly from the terminal window by using "name=$VALUE" command or
sourcing a file with variables using "source $FILE". For the variables in source file to be able
to be sourced, you first need to add "export $VARIABLE" command in such file. You can modify Shell
Variables like that too, although they might revert after logout or restart, since some of them
are defined in startup or logon scripts on your system. If you know of such file, you can source
it to revert the manual change you did to the Shell Variable.

"

lain@WIRED:~$ PS1="$: "
	   $: source ~/.bashrc
lain@WIRED:~$

"

To reference any parameter in your code, you can use curly brackets with a dollar sign in front
of a parameter name or just dollar sign and parameter name. This process is called Parameter 
Expansion:

"

student="Sarah"
echo "Hello {$student}"

OUTPUT:

Hello Sarah

"

User-defined Variables are different than Shell Variables. Shell Variables are defined by Shell
and help with learning about different system information, let you toggle some functions, are
referenced by different commands and scripts and generally can make your scripting more efficient
and to-the-point. Shell Variables are defined using all uppercase for consistency purposes.

There are two types of Shell Variables - Bourne Shell Variables and Bash Shell Variables. As Bash
is a newer version of Bourne Shell, it does contain some of Bourne Shell's variables. As Bash
developed over time, new variables were added that are unique to Bash, which are called Bas
Variables. Sometimes these variables will be available to be used by you on hand in your scripts
or commands. Other times these variables will be significant to a specific command, which will read
data from or save data to one of these specifically named variables.

PATH variable is a Bourne Shell Variable that stores directories in which the system will look for
executables when you issue a command or it's referenced by another program or command.
HOME variable is used to store the absolute path to the current user's home directory.
USER variable contains the username of the current user
HOSTNAME variable contains the hostname of your local machine
HOSTTYPE variable contains processor architecture that the current computer is on
PS1 (Prompt String 1) variable contains the prompt string shown in the terminal before each command

You can manipulate value of a variable while referencing it. It's known as Parameter Expansion and
has to be done in curly braces for it to work.

${name,} translates first letter of the variable to lowercase
${name,,} translates all of the output to lowercase
${name^} translates first letter to uppercase
${name^^} translates all of the output to uppercase
${#name} returns number of characters that the variable's value contains

Substring Expansion, also known as slicing, lets you take a part of parameter's value rather than
all of it

${parameter:offset:length} lets you take a part of the variable starting at offset index and taking
values up to length value. If you leave out ":length" part, Bash will start at offset index and
take the rest of the value up to the end. Remember to leave out the colon, otherwise Bash will
think that you put zero as the lenght. Put a negative offset value with space before it to count
offset from the end of the parameter's value.

Arithmetic Expansion is a Parameter Expansion type which lets you perform arithmetics in shell.
Arithmetic Expansions works only on integer numbers, not decimal numbers. Syntax "$((parameter))" 
will return a result of arithmetic operators you put in the parentheses. You can use variables
inside Arithmetic Expansion without dollar signs and it will work the same. Shell takes into
consideration order of operations, so you don't have to consider this while writing the parameter.
If you want to manually change the order of operations, you have to put into parentheses the 
operation you want to be done first. 

"**" performs exponentiation, which is raising one number to the power of other number.
"%" is a modulo opertator, which gives a remainder of division.
bc (basic calculator) is a programming language in and of itself, which can work with with numbers
to any number of decimal places. bc has an interactive interface which you can open by issuing
"bc" command. In your scripts, instead of using bc interactively, you will pipe the echo with
operation to bc command. bc has internal variable "scale" that defines to how many places after
the decimal point the result output will be calculated.

"

echo "5/2" | bc
2
echo "scale=2; 5/2" | bc
2.50

"

Tilde Expansion lets you easily switch between different home directories and your current and
previous working directories. It's performed using tilde character. Sole tilde character performs
expansion to current user's home directory. It's actually expanding to the current value stored in
$HOME shell variable.

"~$USER" performs Parameter Expansion to a home directory of the user specified.

Bash stores current working directory in an internal variable $PWD (which is called by using "pwd"
command). This variable changes each time you change working directory. The previous directory that
you were in is stored in a variable called $OLDPWD. "~+" is a shortcut to referencing $PWD$
variable. "~-" is a shortcut to referencing $OLDPWD$ variable. Every time you change directory,
$PWD and $OLDPWD variables are updated. That means if you want to switch back and forth between
two directories, you can use "~-" parameter repeatedly. 

Brace Expansion lets you refer to different lists in Bash. Brace Expansion has to have no spaces
between each element for Bash to interpret it correctly. If you put a space inside Brace Expansion,
Bash will interpret it as a whole parameter.
String Lists can contain any set of individual characters or words - {a,19,z,barry,42}
Range Lists let you rapidly expand to sequences of characters that follow a particular pattern, ex.
numbers 1 to 100 or letters A to Z. - {1..100}. Range Lists also work in reverse and you can add a
step to them - {10..1..2}
