Regular variables can oly be used to sotre one piece of data at a time. Indexed Arrays,
however, are a type of variable that lets you store multiple data values at the same time.
Array is declared using parentheses and each value in this Array has to be separated by space.
Arrays can contain both text and number data and the mixture of both. Each value in the Array
has its index. Indexes start from 0 and go up. In Bash, if you do a simple parameter expansion
of an Array, the result will be the zeroeth element of the Array. To access nth index in Array,
you should use Parameter Expansion with curly braces and index stored inside of square brackets.
To access all parameters at once, you should put @ symbol in the square brackets, just like
with accessing all Positional Parameters. Just like with regular Parameter Expansions, you can
use slicing with Parameter Expansion on an Array.

numbers=(1 2 3 4)
echo $numbers		# 1
echo ${numbers[2]} 	# 3
echo ${numbers[@]}	# 1 2 3 4
echo ${numbers[@]:1}	# 2 3 4
echo ${numbers[@]:1:2}  # 2 3

If you want to add an element to the Array, you need to use Array name with += and another
Array with elements to add them to the existing Array.

"

numbers=(1 2 3 4)
echo ${numbers[@]}	# 1 2 3 4
numbers+=(5)
echo ${numbers[@]}	# 1 2 3 4 5

"

To delete an element from the Array, you should use "unset" command along with Array name and
the element you want to delete in square brackets. Unsetting an element in the Array, however,
messes with the indexes. You can see Array indexes by putting exclamation mark in front of the
Array name in Parameter Expansion.

"

echo ${numbers[@]}	# 1 2 3 4 5
unset numbers[2]
echo ${numbers[@]}	# 1 3 4 5
echo ${!numbers[@]}	# 0 1 3 4


"

To change an element in the Array, just type the Array name along with index of the element you
want to change and declare a new value for it.

"

numbers[0]=a
echo ${numbers[@]}	# a 3 4 5

Readarray command lets you generate arrays from files and outputs of commands. Readarray creates
arrays from stdin. Readarray command is followed by the name of the array that will be created
and stdin redirection. Readarray command creates a new Array element for each line that is provided
to it via stdin.
