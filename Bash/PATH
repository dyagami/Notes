PATH is a variable that tells your system where to look for executable files. When you issue a
command, the system looks for executable files with the same name as the command in directories
specified in PATH. You can add your custom scripts or any other programs to your PATH variable 
to make them accessible from within any terminal window, no matter the directory you are in. 

To update PATH variable so that the change is persistent, you should add new line to your ~/.profile
file. .profile file is usually loaded when the shell boots up. To read an updated script into PATH,
you should either logout and log in to terminal back again or use "source ~./profile" to load
.profile file again.

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bash_scripts"

Adding your own script folder further to the left of the PATH variable ensures that your custom
commands will not overwrite system commands if they happen to have the same name. After adding
your directory to PATH, the only thing you have to do for your scripts to work from anywhere in
the terminal, is to add them in the same folder.
