The Read command is a command that lets you ask user for specific input for the script. You can
store this input in a variable or use in another way. When the read command is executed, script
stops and waits for user input. The Read command serves the same purpose as Positional Parameters,
but lets the user input information while specifically asked to do so by the script instead of
inputting it on start. By default, user's input is stored in the REPLY variable. If you want to
declare variables with user input, you can follow the read command with variable names and then
Bash will ask for input, which you can provide for each of these variables separated by spaces.
"read -p "$PROMPT" $VARNAME" command will ask for user input while displaying a prompt.
"-t $SECONDS" argument adds timeout to user input prompt after which it continues with the rest
of the script. 
"-s" argument prevents user input from showing while the user is typing. "-N $CHARS" argument
specifies exactly how many characters the input has to have for the command to return successfull
value. 

The Select command lets you create selection menu for the user input. Select command presents the
user with a menu, from which he will makes a selection that gets saved in a variable. The first
argument you pass to the Select command is a variable name. If none is given, the answer will be
saved in $RESPONSE variable. If you don't specify an option or specify non-existent option, the
variable will remain empty. After getting an answer, select command loops back to selection by
default. To prevent this looping behavior, you should add "break" reserved word just after your
desired code. To show custom text in front of selection prompt, you should modify $PS3 variable,
which contains Select command's prompt string.
